\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\label{ch:Results-and-Discussion}
Following the brief example demonstration of the method in Chapter \ref{ch:Methodology}, we extended the implementation to house 12 of the \gls{refit} data set. The subsequent sections serve to demonstrate the efficacy of both the classification step as well as the forecasting step of our method. 

\section{Cluster Label Classification}
\label{sec:Results-and-Discussion:Cluster-Label-Classification}
The first results that we will be demonstrating are that of the classification step of our method -- refer to Table \ref{tab:Classification-results}.

        \begin{tabular*}{\linewidth}{c@{\extracolsep{\fill}}c@{\extracolsep}c} \toprule
                \tableheadline{Data Set} & \tableheadline{No. of Clusters} & \tableheadline{Accuracy} \\ \midrule
                \gls{ucid}               & 3                               & 76\%                     \\ \midrule
                \gls{refit} - House 12   & 3                               & 66\%                     \\ \bottomrule
        \end{tabular*}
        \caption{Result of training, optimizing and evaluating a random forest classifier on the cluster labels obtained for each of the \gls{ucid} as well as the \gls{refit} data sets.}
        \label{tab:Classification-results}
\end{table}

\noindent \newline Being able to correctly assign new samples into the correct cluster is imperative so as to insure the highest likelihood of achieving consistently reliable forecasting accuracy. Given that we had an equal number of 3 clusters per data set and that we were working with a (synthetic) uniform distribution of samples over the different clusters, the scores outlined in Table \ref{tab:Classification-results} are fairly good (a random predictor would achieve an accuracy of 33.3\%). The disparity in the results between the 2 data sets could predominantly be linked to the following 2 reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \gls{ucid} data set contained a much larger number of samples (days).
    \item The distribution of the samples over the different days of the week as well as the months is much more uniform in the \gls{ucid} data set.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \newline Figures \ref{fig:UCID-Classification-Confusion-Matrix} and \ref{fig:REFIT-Classification-Confusion-Matrix} allow us to clearly visualize both the correct as well as the incorrect predictions made by our model. Interestingly, given that both the clusters formed for each of the \gls{ucid} as well as the \gls{refit} data set were quite similar in terms of the overall patterns that were captured, the fitted model per data set seems to be making mistakes, or otherwise incorrect predictions, of a similar magnitude with cluster 2 containing the largest number of incorrect predictions for each of the data sets and cluster 1 containing the largest amount of correct predictions.

\section{Forecasting Accuracy}
\label{sec:Results-and-Discussion:Forecasting-Accuracy}
When compared to the current state-of-the-art in modern literature, particularly with regards to data available on hand pertaining to the \gls{ucid} data set, our method yields superior forecasting accuracy at variable resolution. Table \ref{tab:Forecasting-results} presents a performance comparison of common models discussed in the literature and our method. We note that, at the time of writing, no published results attempting to forecast energy consumption on the \gls{refit} data set could be found and thus, barre attempting to recreate the results ourselves, we have had to omit them from Table \ref{tab:Forecasting-results} for the time being.

                                             & Proposed               & 0.11                     & 0.17                      & 25.77\%              \\ \bottomrule
        \end{tabular*}
        \caption{Performance comparison of different methods on each of \gls{ucid} as well as the \gls{refit} data set. Note that these results were obtained for one-step-ahead prediction at a resolution of 15 minutes over the raw data sets.}
        \label{tab:Forecasting-results}
\end{table}

\noindent \newline Another component that is frequently (attempted to be) forecasted in the literature is the trend component obtained as part of a time-series decomposition step that was previously discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:Exploratory-Data-Analysis}. We attempted to tackle this problem ourselves and applied the method to both the smoothed, trend component of the \gls{ucid} data set as well as house 12 of the \gls{refit} data set, the results of which can be seen in Table \ref{tab:Forecasting-results-2}. We note that the results here are considerably good, achieving a \gls{mape} of $\sim 2\%$ for both  data sets.

\begin{table}[H]
        \myfloatalign
        \centering
        \begin{tabular*}{\linewidth}{c@{\extracolsep{\fill}}c@{\extracolsep{\fill}}c@{\extracolsep{\fill}}c} \toprule
                \tableheadline{Data Set} & \tableheadline{MAE (kW)} & \tableheadline{RMSE (kW)} & \tableheadline{MAPE} \\ \midrule
                \gls{ucid}               & 0.02                     & 0.02                      & 2.58\%               \\ \midrule
                \gls{refit}              & 0.02                     & 0.02                      & 4.32\%                \\ \bottomrule
        \end{tabular*}
        \caption{Performance metrics obtained when applying our method on the trend component of each of the \gls{ucid} as well as the \gls{refit} data sets to obtain a one-step-ahead prediction.}
        \label{tab:Forecasting-results-2}
\end{table}

\noindent \newline Finally, we attempted to extend our model by scaling up the number of predictions from a singular step (15 minutes into the future in this scenario) to a total of 12 sequential steps (leading to a grand total of 3 hours being forecasted given the previously mentioned step size of 15 minutes) ,the results of which can be seen in Table \ref{tab:Forecasting-results-3}. Oddly enough, for both the \gls{ucid} data set as well as house 12 of the \gls{refit} data set, we achieved marginal improvements with regards to \gls{mape} scores when attempting to build twelve-step-ahead forecasts on their respective trend components. On the other hand, \gls{mape} scores for the raw data for each of our data sets fell somewhat substantially, with an overall loss of about $\sim 10\%$, when moving from one-step-ahead forecasts to twelve-step-ahead forecasts which is more in line with what one could expect in this scenario.

\noindent \newline To further showcase, or otherwise visualize, the capabilities of our model we present Figures \ref{fig:UCID-RAW-1-Step-Ahead-Forecast-Result}, \ref{fig:UCID-Trend-1-Step-Ahead-Forecast-Result}, \ref{fig:REFIT-RAW-1-Step-Ahead-Forecast-Result} and \ref{fig:REFIT-Trend-1-Step-Ahead-Forecast-Result} that serve to illustrate one-step-ahead forecasts generated for a subset of each of the \gls{ucid} data set as well as house 12 of the \gls{refit} data set. These figures illustrate predictions made by each of our individual models on both the raw data as well as the trend component for each of the \gls{refit} data set as well as the \gls{ucid} data set over a period of 1 day out of our test set. The days chosen for these illustrations were completely random.
